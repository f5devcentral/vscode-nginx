# vscode-nginx

initial draft of vscode extension for nginx, mainly nginx instance manager (NIM)

The idea is to have an extension for everything nginx, but would plugin or add on to the main vscode-f5 extension.  This would ensure that this extension has all the tools that come with the main vscode-f5 extension but not cluttered with all the tmos stuff.  So, whole new view with all nginx specific stuff.

All of this is very early stages but wanted to get a framework so others can see the options.

So, all the menu's, icons, and layout can/will change.  Looking for feedback on workflows and UI as we explore this integration more.

Also, looking at the vscode marketplace, you will see a couple of extensions that may already handle some necessary functionality (language server), so we might need to look into how they solved some of these needs.

I think the language server is going to be a big part and benefit of the config authoring process (like the irules/iapps/other nginx extensions)
